## SERVER

- improve logging
- Direct / private messages between users
- List chat users - http ( not enforced, could be ws if so desired )
- Multiple rooms - users can chat on different rooms
    - list chat rooms
- config server - url / port 
    - options:
        - envvars
        - file config


Nice to have, but not required:

- Load chat history when connecting *** 
    - will have to preserve state - how? files, db?
- User login - bind connection to username 
    - should we change username? how? 

---

## CLIENT

- accept input from stdin
- quit / disconnect 
- config server connection params: - url etc 
    - options:
        - envvars
        - file config
- NOTE: does not have to be written in go. Web based is perfectly fine.


### TESTING & Running

- should have a good mix of unit tests ( where needed & relevant, do not go overboard ) & integration tests / e2e tests.
- can be run locally or packaged in a docker image, choice is yours.
